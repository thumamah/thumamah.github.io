            We also have to draw attention to the defining feature of Dubai, it's ultramodern architecture resulting in a distinct skyline. Burj Khalifa, an 830m-tall tower, dominates the skyscraper-filled skyline, helping Dubai to hold the title of the worlds tallest skyline. On a visit here be sure to travel to the top to get a view from the worlds second tallest observation deck and take in the skyline with a backdrop of magnificant coastline. At its foot lies Dubai Fountain, with jets and lights choreographed to music. On artificial islands just offshore is Atlantis, The Palm, a resort with water and marine-animal parks. Dubai's modern take on classic Islamic architecture has helped to seperate it from much of the rest of the wrold.
