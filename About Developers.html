						<h1>Introduction</h1>
						<hr>
						Programming is at the very core of IT. Many IT graduates start out on their career path as programmers, and programming is the basis of a wide range of processes, skills and activities. But what does it actually involve?
					</p>
					<h1>What the job involves</h1>
					<hr>
						<p>
							Well, the work varies hugely, depending on both the organisation and the software being produced, but all programmers essentially write instructions that a computer can interpret. This means establishing a detailed specification and clarifying exactly what a programme needs to do, then breaking the specification down to its simplest elements and translating this into an appropriate programming language. Different tasks require different programming languages, but those most in demand are Visual Basic, Java, XML and C++. Most programmers specialise in a few different languages, and the ability to learn and adapt quickly is a must.
					</p>
					<h1>How your career can develop</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>
						There are two distinct areas of expertise within programming: applications programmers and systems programmers (also known as systems developers). Applications programmers write programmes that process and manage incoming information on the computer (database systems): including anything from payroll data to scientific calculations.

Systems programmers deal with the internal operations of the computer: this could involve designing diagnostic programs to finding faults or controlling the way a computer runs several applications simultaneously. Programmers usually create programmes from specifications designed by systems analysts or borne out of direct consultation with clients – the size and role of the organisation will determine the source.


Programmers generally specialise in commercial data work, scientific applications or computing, or programmes for the home or educational computer market. Working hours are generally a standard seven to eight-hour day but this can change depending on the project, and flexibility is important. Programmers can work anywhere – IT and programming language skills are universal and very exportable.
